               <p>I would say I’m not a competitive person.. But that would be a complete lie. One Tuesday meeting Jackson was bragging about how he was going to be the first in the club to bag Zekes Hut in the Hihitahi Forest Park that weekend. I secretly thought it would be really funny if I drove up on Friday after work so that I could be ready waiting for him when he arrived on Saturday. Luckily for Jackson, I already had a tramp planned for Burn Hut that weekend. Unluckily for Jackson, Chris managed to convince him to come on my tramp instead, which I’m sure he regrets considering how unhinged that trip turned out. Unbeknownst to Jackson, I had a work trip coming up requiring me to literally drive right past the entrance to the Hihitahi Forest on my way home.
               <br><br>It’s a pretty normal track - mud, trees & a scenic view across the Rangipo Desert. Tbh it just made me remember my time doing basic training in the army which was not good vibes. The hut is nice & new, but I still had a three hour drive ahead of me so I smashed a Cookie Time cookie & a shot of rum with the hunter staying there. I ran the whole way back to the car in my heavy boots, whimsically sliding down all the muddy slopes & skipping over fallen trees & losing the trail markers. You might think it was the rum, but I’d say I was just high on the satisfaction of being there first.

               <p>For a couple of years I had wanted to go to Zeke's Hut. The Hut is the only one in it's forest sanctuary, in the middle of nowhere of SH1, and most importantly - no one in the club (so far as we could tell from the Hut baggers) had been to the hut before.
                <br><br>Or, at least that was before I was manipulated and betrayed by none other than our at-the-time president, Kathleen 'The Deceiver' Griffin. I had planned to run the trip two weekends before the actual trip date, but was convinced to go on a trip with Kat and some others to Burn Hut instead when most others on my trip had pulled out as it was 'too far away for a walk shorter than the drive'. Little did I know that I was being manipulated to delay my trip so Kat could get all the glory the week after when passing through on her way to Auckland. I'm not bitter at all.
                <br><br>I mean, I'm not saying that she was impeached from her position as president after this incident and had to go into exile in the 'lower island', but... y'know ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. However, I can safely say that I am the first person in the club to have slept in the Hut - which is what really counts (right?).
                <br><br>As for the tramp - 8 hours drive for 4-5 hours walking, and getting cut up af by cutting grass, but the hut was pretty cute. 5/7, would definitely give it a go if I were passing through.</p>
